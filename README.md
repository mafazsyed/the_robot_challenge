# Omnidirectional Mecanum-Wheeled Drawing Robot

## Project Overview
This repository contains the design and code for the robot used to take part in The Robot Challenge 2023.

### Key Features
- **Omnidirectional Movement:** Utilizes mecanum wheels to achieve movement in any direction.
- **Custom Hardware Integration:** Combines Arduino, servos, and DC motors with a laser-cut plywood base and a partly 3D-printed robotic arm.
- **Advanced Programming:** Features autonomous navigation and the ability to draw shapes, programmed in C++ using state case logic, interrupts, and encoders for precise control.
